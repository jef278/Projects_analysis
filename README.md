## 1_Image analysis 2p or not 2p?
Written for GoogleCoLab - Remember to save model after training. TRaining and validation sets currently set at 20% validation : 80% training

## 2_Straight FCS fitting method
Old school FCS analysis, model contains parameters for triplet quenching, 1-3 species present. Applyign Stokes-Einstein model and assuming spherical particles

## 3_MEMFCS - using maximum entropy methods for fitting
Adaptation of Maiti et al (REF) using python. Use modelling function to check the validity.
